# Create a Web UI with ASP.NET Core

The main branch has my own complete solution and project for the Microsoft Learn [Create a web UI with ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/create-razor-pages-aspnet-core/) Microsoft Training module. The main branch has additional code commentary and my style of coding (for example: I try not to use var) compared to the Microsoft solution branch. 

## Recommendations

To view and manage the embedded SQL database in Visual Studio 2022, it is recommended to download and install ["SQLite and SQL Server Compact Toolbox"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ErikEJ.SQLServerCompactSQLiteToolbox) from the Visual Studio Marketplace. This extension adds several features to help your embedded database development efforts: Scripting of tables and data, import from SQL Server and CSV files and much, much more.

## How to Run Locally
